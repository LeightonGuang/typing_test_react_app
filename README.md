[The Next Typer](https://thenexttyper.netlify.app/) is a feature rich typing test website built with Next.js, Shadcn and Recharts. Test your speed and accuracy and track your progress with Recharts. This revamped version enahances the original [typing test website](https://github.com/LeightonGuang/typing_test) using technologies I've recently learned.
